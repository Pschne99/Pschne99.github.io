My name is Paul Schneidewind Telge and I come from Peru, Lima. I moved to germany to study physics and now I am finishing my masters degree at [Ludwig-Maximilian-Universität](https://www.lmu.de/de/). I am spending a lot of time at [the university observatory](https://www.usm.lmu.de/), where I am doing my thesis on the Holographic principle in QFT via overlapping degrees of freedom.

I am also very intersested in particle phyiscs and mathematical descriptions of the fundamental forces of nature, such as gravity and Yang-Mills Theory.
